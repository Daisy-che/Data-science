# Data-science
Data-science contain  a description of tuple and stack and how operation are performed

## Stack

Stack is a linear datastructure that follows the last -in-First -out principle.Elements are added and removed from the same end  of a stack.The last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.Adding an element to a stack is called 'push' operation.Removing an element from a stack is called 'pop' operation.Accessing elements  in the stack we use the indexing position.

## Tuple

A collection of elements  separated by commas and enclosed in parentheses.Tuples are immutable ,it cannot be changed , used to represent fixed collection of items.Accessing element is a tuple is done  using indexing .You can concatenate items in a tuple using + operator.Iterate  over items in a tuple using loops.Checking if an element exist in a tuple using "in" operator.

## Queue 

Is a linear data structure that stores items in a First In  First Out(FIFO)manner.Queue are a implemented using a list and dequeue(), append() and pop() function is used.
